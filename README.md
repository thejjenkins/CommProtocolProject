# Packet Communication

## _Introduction_
I researched computer networking and communication protocols for a little over one semester. I studied the [MIN protocol](https://github.com/min-protocol/min.git) and implemented a [working product](https://github.com/thejjenkins/min.git) based on the original. I learned what [communication protocols](https://www.practicalnetworking.net/series/packet-traveling/osi-model/) are and [what they look like](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/12/framing-in-serial-communications/#id10).

## _Motivation_
To write my own  communication protocol. To put the theoretical knowledge into use by creating my own communication protocol. 

## _Goals_
### 5/21/24
* Create two branches:
    * picoH
    * STM32
* ~~Write bare-bones UART send/receive messages on both devices~~
* write a data-link layer for loopback testing on Pi Pico H

## _Misc_
Anything extra I want to add such as references or images.
